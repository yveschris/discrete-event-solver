# world's first discrete event solver
computer_network_simulator_in_python: computer network simulator using discrete event solver.

Such a simulator has two major advantages:
1. super fast: it's supposed to be at least 100x faster than the conventional network simulators that use discrete event simulation
2. super easy to read and super simple to develop your own ideas: the codes are written in Python and the total line number is less than 1k.

I'm committed to this simulator to make sure that it will be a real computer network simulator and other types of simulators based on this discrete-event simulator. Enjoy!

TO DO:
1. to improve the server side's response performance
2. https
3. scaling law problem
4. tcp capability
5. dynamic routing
6. animation

## usage
run netsim_client.py in the computer_network_simulator_in_python folder
